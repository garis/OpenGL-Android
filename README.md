Some test on the openGL on android

This project is an experiment to understand to use openGL on android.

TESTING:
Inside "app/build/outputs/apk/" there is a file called "app-debug.apk".
This apk is configured to run Lattice-Boltzamann 2D fluids simulations using openGL to draw the result.

In the code there is also an another test class that show a simple scene with some rotating object extracted from a 3D .obj files and some sample text.

Thanks to www.physics.weber.edu/schroeder/fluids for share a simple java implementation of the simulation.
